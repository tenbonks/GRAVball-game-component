# gravBALL-game-component

Howdy, here is a game which involves as good amount of reaction speed, mixed with timing.
The goal is to get past the obstacles by manipulating gravity, simply HOLD DOWN LEFT or RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, or SPACEBAR (click the canvas if it's not registering input via KEY)

#UX

It is aimed for the casual gamer, who like *physic based reaction games*, such as the classic Helicopter game, well... This is like that, but with a twist. 

The website consits of simply the title, the game and a information box displaying controls. the website is essentialy a landing page so no navigation is required, meaning there is no navigation through the site, other than getting straight to the game.

The controls are intuitive, simply hold down click/spacebar
